# toy-robot
A walking robot that is placed on the 5 x 5 board. The board can be adjusted through code change. I didn't put some flexibility on the board's dimension

## requirements
1. .Net 5.0. I created this simple console application on top of .Net 5.0. I already removed most of the other versions. 
2. You can either use Visual Studio Code or Visual Studio that supports .Net 5.0.
3. You need to know how to build the application. :)

## how to run
1. download or clone the repository.
2. go to the local directory where the repository was cloned.
3. open the ToyRobot.sln by double-clicking to launch the Visual Studio IDE or you can open the entire folder/workspace in Visual Studio Code.
4. build the application.
5. press f5 to directly run the application and input the required commands
or you can use a text file that contains the required command to start. `ToyRobot.exe test.txt`
